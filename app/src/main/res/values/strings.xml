    <string name="about_alfred">
        Alfred Kondoro is a creative designer, with experience designing graphics and developing software. My background in graphics designing and software development shows my mindful but competitive approach. I am fueled by my passion for understanding and solving problems. I consider myself a ‘forever student,’ eager to both build on my academic foundations in Computer Studies and stay in tune with the latest technological innovations through continued coursework.
\n\n
My hunger for knowledge and determination to turn information into action has contributed to my most recent success at various companies and start-ups in Tanzania. Meanwhile, I have vastly improved the productivity of my team by implementing strategic project management methods and ensuring a work-life balance for my team.
\n\n
I believe mindfulness in the workplace is key to success. I live out through my interests in meditation, vacationing and painting. I am currently working as a freelance graphic designer and software developer and is always interested in a challenge. \n\n Reach out to alfredkondoro97@gmail.com to connect!</string>
